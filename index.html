            <h1>Tigers</h1>
            <p>Tigers are majestic and powerful big cats, renowned for their striking orange coats with bold black stripes. Native to Asia, they are the largest members of the cat family and symbolize strength and courage. Tigers are apex predators, playing a vital role in maintaining ecological balance by controlling prey populations. Sadly, they are endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. Conservation efforts like wildlife sanctuaries and anti-poaching initiatives aim to protect these magnificent creatures and ensure their survival for future generations.</p>
